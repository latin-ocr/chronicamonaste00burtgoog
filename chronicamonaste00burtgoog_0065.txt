be in N os. 124 and 127 of Dodsworth's collection in the

III. Chartularies and regisbers. of these I know
only two original manuscripts.

1. A chartulam, now Lansdowne MS. 424, in {zhe
British Museum. Ib is on vellum, and of the fourteenth
century, and consiste of 156 leaves, At folio 3 is a note
by Sir Christopher Hyldyard, showing that it belonged to
him in the year 1553,1 and ab the bostom of the last page
are the initials W. K, and the date 1722, indicating that
it had been in the hands (on loan) of Dr. Whibe Kenneb
in that year. The earlier half of the volume, to folio 58,
contains copies of papa] bulls, episcopal documenta, and
royal charbem, the lates‘o date of which is the year 1371.
These are succeeded by copies of charbem, dated as late

⁰ as 1390, and arranged under some of the parishes in

which the monastery held estates, the volume being im-
perfect.. From folio 78 the enbries are by a. hand distinct
from and later than sshose of the previous pages. I notioe
ent-ries in Burton’s handwriting at. folios 31 b and ’77 b.

I have met with extr-acts from this MS. in H arleian
6975, f. 59, made by Dr. Matthew Hutton ; in Lansdowne
973, pp. 132-154‚ made by Dr. white Kenneb, when the
MS. was in the possession of Mr. Thornbon‚ of Wakefield ;
and in Lansdowne 421, 964, and 968. It· was probably
also the source of some extracts from a. chartulary of
Melsa. in Dodsworth's collection, Nos, 53 and 95.

century, now the Cottonian MS. Vitellius O. vi„ in the
