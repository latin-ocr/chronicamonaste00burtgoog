purchaseS, we may assume that about a hundred and
thirty marks were raised by these 611166.ι

Τ116 011161· 1660111666 of the monastery would be the
sale of their wool, always a considerable item, their farm
produce, and live stock. After the exhaustion of these
means, the only remaining source of supply would be by
106116, 6 common practice with religione housae, who
could offer* sound security as corporate bodies, though
the interest they would be committed to at this period
-the beginning of the thirteenth century—would be

driven to 6611 their stores of corn and winter provisione,
they must needs have sought sustenanoe elsewhere. The
monks distributed themselves, not, as was the custom,
among monaster-ies of their order in England, for 110116
was able to receive them ; but some were received by the
abbot of St. Mary's of York‚ others by the prior of Brid-
lington, some were sent to Cistercian houses in Scotland,
while others, an unexampled 6666 111 1116 history of the
order, were driven to seek shelter-monks and converte,
ten or fifteen together, or at least by twos and threes-——in
neighbouring villages and castles, where they could best

ever, was not of long duration. They were all reunited,
we may imagine with what feelings of delight, on the
161 of November following. But it 16 natural 10 reflect
that if the manner of life of the monks was at all of the
secluded and ascetic character the constitutions of the
order enjoined, their forced return into 1116 world must
have sadly discomposed their ideas, and probably for
some time after the event diverted them from holier
meditations by the temptation to compare their several
adventures.
