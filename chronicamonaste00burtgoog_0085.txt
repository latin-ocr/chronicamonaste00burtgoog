authority. As, for instance, under the first abbot Adam,
he adds the patronymic of Thwayte to the name of the
sainted archbishop William Fitz-He1·bert;¹ and for this
I find no precedent in any history of the period. He
mentions too an outrage committed by the partisans
of the same William in Fountains abbey, in an attempt
upon the person of his successful rival in the election,
Henry Murdac‚ an incident of which Stubbs makes no
mention, but which is described in Serlo’s chronicle of
Fountains,² although in different termS‚ and more shortly
by John of Hexham.

In treating of events in English history our author
has chiefly followed Ralph Higden‚ and not unfrequently
the work commonly ascribed to John of Brompton. I
never find him borrowing the language of the St. Alban’s
writers or of the works derived from them. Confining
myself to the portions contained in the present volume,
I will point out the immediate sources of the English
historical narrative under the successive abbots.

Under Adam, the first abbot, the twenty-first chapter
of the original work commences an abstract of affairs
from the death of Henry Ι. This is derived from the
chronicles of Henry of Huntingdon, John of Brompton,
and Higden‚ sometimes in substance only, sometimes in
verbal quotations. The account of the battle of the
Standard is taken from Ain-ed of Rivaulx and Henry of
Huntingdon, although expressions occur not traceable to

either of these authors.
⁵ Chapter xxxi. gives a narrative of the crusade of king
Louis and the emperor Conrad in the year 1147, partly
in the words of Brompton and Higden, but principally
from another source not ascertained.

Chapters xxxii—xxxiv are taken up with an abridg-
ment of Hemy of Sawtry's narrative of the knight
