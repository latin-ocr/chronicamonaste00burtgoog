xxxvi PREFAGE.

Among the additions 'made to the property of the
house during abbot Alexander's government were an
estate called Stockholme, near Hedon‚ containing
seventy acres of land, but which was granted out to fes
farm3 the estate of Orwythfleet in Pensthorpe (now sub-
merged by the Humber)‚ which the donor, Osbert of
Frismarsh, endeavoured to reclaim, commencing proceed-
ings in the court of Rome, but eventually secured to
the monastery, becoming a novics in it himself; half a
carucate of land in Biston, adjoining Meaux on the
north-east, from Walter de Fauconberg, lord of Rise‚

now Arnold, to the east of Meaux, four oxgangs and

sources of the monastery, for we find mention of more
than one sale of land during his abbacy, in one instance
for as much as a hundred marks. How distasteful it was
to a religious house to part with property it had once
acquired is instanced in the circumstance that, on one
of these occasions of abbot Alexander having disposed
of a few aerea the monks so strenuously protested against
it that he was induced to repurchase the land at a· loss.
