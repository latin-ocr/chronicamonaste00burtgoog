the reader not to attribute to his invention what he may
find new to him in the ensuing narrative, for he may be
assured that he states nothing for which he has not
authority, either in the works of others, and in different
memoranda (including, we may presume, the charters of
the house), or in the relation of trustworthy persons, or
in his own observation.

But we have something more than inference of the
existence of narrative pieces at the time when Burton
composed his work ; we have direct references to them by
himself in his own register of documents relating to the
monastery, which we have already described3 and we
have an entry of a history of the abbey in the inventory
of the conventual library contained in the same volume.

At folio 103 of the register compiled by Burton‚ he
gives an historical view of the question of exemption of
lands, held by the monastery in their own cultivation,
from the payment of tithe. In the course of it he makes
frequent reference to authorities, in these termS, “ sicut
“ patet per cronicas et alia monasterii memoranda ;’'
“ sicut patet per cronicam monasterii de tempore Adae
‘² abbatis primi ;’' and similarly for every abbot down
to Michael, the eighth abbot, whose period was from 1235
to 1249. It might be understood thatin these references
Burton was quoting his own work, as, indeed, the sub-
ject treated of is usually to be found there; but that
these chronicles of the earlier abbots were distinct from
his own narrative is rendered certain by other referenceS,
in these terme„ “sicut patet per cronicam antiquam
“ monasterii de tempore Thomae abbatis 3,'’ (ob. 1197),
folio 110 b ; and “ sicut patet per parvum rotulum
“ antiquae cronicae monasterii, anno Domini MCOXV.,” on
the same page ; and, again, “ in antiqua cronica monas-
“ terii anno ab incarnatione Domini Mccxn.,” folio 114 ;
and, finally, “ sicut patet per antiquum rotulum cronicae
“ tempore Michaelis abbatis,” viz„ from 1235 to 1249,
folio 134.
