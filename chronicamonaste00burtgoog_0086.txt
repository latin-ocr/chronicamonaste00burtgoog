Owen⁸s visit to St. Patriek's purgatory, distinet from that
given by wendover in his “ Flores Historiarum? ¹ It
will be remembered that one of the subsequent abbote
of Meaux had been a monk of Sawtry, and would natu-
rally be a means of drawing the attention of the eonvent
to the marvels recorded in that veracious dooument.

The thirty-ssah chapter gives the genealogy ef king
Hem-y, found 111 both Assred of Rivaulx and Roget
wendover, but Burton has taken it, I think, from a die-
tinet authority. And in the thirty-sixth chapter is
introduoed a legendary narrative of the eeeape of Harold
from the field of Hastings, of 1118 after-life as a her-mit,
and 1118 death at chester, forty-six years aster the battle.
This story 18 not in any of the werke consulted by our
author for his epitome of English history, nor am I
avare of ite being in any form in print. It is extant,
however, in a distinet piene, contained in the Harleian
MS. 3⁷76, fol. 1.g

In the period of Alexander, the second abbot‚ from
1159 to 1185, the prinoipal subject 111 our author'e Eng-
11811 history is the career of Thomas Becket‚ oeeupying
8111 chapters. He cites at the end of his narrative the
Quadrilogus, as oompiled by a monk of Evesham‚ stating
the names of the several authors, and of Benediet of
Peterborough‚ 111 the words of the prologue. In the
earlier part of 1118 narrative he epitomieee in 1118 own
language 3 111 the latter he more often adopts the expres-
sions of 1118 authorities.

'l'he history of the erueade under Philip of Franee
and Riohard Ι., treated of under the third abbot, Thomas,
shows symptoms of an authority distinet from those I
have referred to in the margin of the text, Benediet of
Peterborough, Higden‚· and John of Brompton, but I fail
100 detecta any quotation from the other known historians
