after mentioning that Sir Robert de Thumham, deputed
by Richard to administer the affairs of Cyprus when
he sailed from it for Aere, had put to death by hanging
a certain monk who had attempted to seize the throne,
it is added, that, when Thurnham reported the event to
Richard‚ he was reproached by the imperious sovereign
with having disgraced royalty by applying that mode of

Robert Thurnham himself, who was connected with the
abbey of Meaux by his marriage with J oan, daughter
and heiress of william Fossard, from whom they had

Gerbertus, elected pope under the name of Silvester

his language is adopted verbatim. Yet I doubt his being
an authority directly referred to by our chronicler.

Under the fifth abbot, Hugh, we come upon traces of
a work which 1 believe was much followed by Burton
in the succeeding portione of his historical narrative-
