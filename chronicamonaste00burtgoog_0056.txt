affairs of the monastery. The system on which the
author arranged his work was, under each abbot, to
toeat first of all the matters relating to the monastery,
its acquisitione of land, ite lawsuitS, and the various
incidente affecting it, in separate chapters, but without
interruptim of the narrative by extraneous matter. On
coming to the conclusion of the abbot’s government, he
commenced a short relation of leading events in general
history, particularly of the succession of the popes, and
affairs connected with the court of Rome ; and then, at
greater length, reviewed the principal events of English
history for the period comprised in the abbot’s tenure of
office. On the whole, this historical matter in the first
copy of the work, in the Philllpps MS„ amounts to as
much es the purely conventual part of the chronicle.
But in the revised copy, in the Egerton MS„ the his·
torical portione, as Ι have already stated, are reduced
to a very meagre epitome. In order, therefore, to pre-
serve the integrity of the original work, it became
necessary to follow a different plan in dealing with these 3
and Ι judged it best to print them entire, as parts of
the text, from the Phillipps MS„ and, that nothing of
the Egerton recension might be omitted, to add the
corresponding porticus in that MS. as appendices to the
history of each abbot. And this is the plan followed m
the present publication.

A further difference between the two manuscripts
appeared in the division of chapters under some of the
abbote. Thus, under Adam the first abbot, chapter iv.
of the Philipps MS. is divided into chapters iv. and V.
in the Egel-ton MS„ so that chapter v. of the former
corresponde with chapter vi. of the latter. When follow-
ing the text of the Egerton MS. for the monastic part of
the chronicle, Ι have of course adhered to the divisione
of chapters which it exhibite, and the variatione in the
order introduced in the Phillipps MS. Ι have pointed out
in the notes3 but, in taking up this latter MS. fot the
