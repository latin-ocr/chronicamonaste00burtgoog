The monk was to be selected by the abbot, with the
advice of the father abbot or visitor and 1113 own con-
vent, and was termed the scholar of his house. He was
to receive from 1113 abbot fifteen pounds, Tours, for his
purse and expensos, and as much for books and common
charges of the college. The study of canon law was
specially prohibited. From 1113 being characterised as
“ bene literatus ” by the continuator of 1113 chronicle, it
is probable that Thomas Burton had been the scholar
of Meaux in his youth ; and the advantage he would
have gained by such a privilege, and the degree of su-

joined a note of changes in office-holders made at the
latter date, when Burton was deprived of the office of
bursar, conferred upon John of Whitby and Richard of
Esk conjointly. In a second similar list, drawn up by
