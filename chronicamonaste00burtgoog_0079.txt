“ Thomas Burton, nonus decimus abbas de Melea, obiit
“ quarto nonas Octobris, anno Domini ccccoxxxvn0.
“ Sua anima in pace req[uiescat].” The figure holds a
broken crozier, to indicate his retirement from the office
of abbot previous to his death. We have it, therefore,
on the best authority that he survived to the year 1437.
I may add that the change in Burton’s handwriting in
the great register of his own compilation, Cottonian MS.
Vitellius G. vi„ remarkably coufirms the statement that
116 lost his eyesight in the later years of his life.

The abbot of FountainS, in accepting the resignation

‘of Burton, assigned δ’) him for the remainder of his life

a, chamber in the monks' infirmary, an annual pension
of forty shillings, with other liberties and favours} A
position more favourable for the composition of a literary
work such as he engaged himself in we can hardly
conce1ve.

It remains to inquire from what sources Burton
derived, the materiale for his chronicle. He would have
access to the archives of the monastery, containing the
original charters of donation of their estateS, papal
bulls of privileges and royal confirmationS, as far
as they were preserved, and to such registers of these
documents as may have been extant at the time 116
was writing. A portion of one such chartulary we have
seen is still extant, composed not long before Burton'
would have commences] his work, and in which I have
pointed out additional entries in his own hand ; and he
quotes a register of the monastery in the feodary which
116 himself compiled. Having held the office of bursa-r,
he would have had in his keeping the accounts of
receipts and issues of the general purse, which, if they
extended far back, he must have found invaluable for

 

 

 

¹ His predecessor, William of teen marks, a double portion of food,
Scarborough, on his resignation, two servants, and a monk as ser·

had been allowed a pensiori of thir-⁸ vitor.
