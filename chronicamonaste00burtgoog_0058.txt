tion of Thomas de Burton, the nineteenth abbot‚ gives of the·
us the valuable information that this abbot was himself ⁰¹¹³⁰¹²¹⁰¹2
the author of the first chronicle‚ stating that he resigned

the abbacy in the year 1399, and occupied his retirement
until some eight years before his death, when he became
blind, in composing the annals of the monastery. He

sixteenth century, they are not written in what was
originally one volume. The paper of the earlier work has
