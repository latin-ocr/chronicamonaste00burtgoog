of the order —the house of Citaux being at the time with-

out an abbot. And he had the honour of sitting at 1116

chapter as one of the four principal abbots‚ having been

chosen to take the place of the absent abbot of 011111-

vaux, a supportet· of the anti-pope, Clemcnt VII. Im-
mediately on Burton’s return home, Robert Burley‚ abbot

of Fountain3‚ made a visitation to Meaux abbey as father
