protectore, advisere, and instructore of the poor ; how,
as considerable landowners, they were interested in the
political concerns of the kingdom, exercieing by combi-
nation among themselves, and the support of the court
of Rome, a seneible influence on the direction of public
affairs ; we ought to be prepared to allow to them a large
share in the formation of the national character and in
‘the general progress of the country.

The reasons that the operation of these monastic in-
stitutione has not been fully displayed are not far to seek.
Foremost, are the religione animositiee that the subject
too surely awakens3 then, the disposition to eit in judg-

not at all for the prying eyes of the sceptical generations
which have since satin judgment on them. But although
such a record was probably kept in most convente, no
great number of purely conventual historice bave come
down to us. The chronicles of relig-ioue houses are
