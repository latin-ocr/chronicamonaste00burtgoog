That the handwriting of the chronicle itself was iden-
tical with that of the Egerton MS. I felt assured3 but
there was this peculiarity in it, that it showed a con-
siderable change of character in the progress of the
work; the difference between the writing of the begin-
ning of the chronicle and the latter part of it being
decidedly marked, and its agreement with the writing
in the Egerton MS. becoming closer towards its con-
clusion. The question of the true relation of the one
MS. to the other—-each appearing to be the autograph of
the author—could only be determined by a collation
of the texts. Every facility for this labour was most
readily and kindly‘afforded me by Sir Thomas Phillipps,
by whose kindness Ι have been enabled to make repeated
examinatione of his MS.

The result of a partia-l comparison of the texts was to
make evident that the newly found copy—which I cite
throughout as the Phillipps MS.—was the first draught
of the work, and that the Egerton MS. was a some-
what later recension by the author, containing many
passages wanting in the earlier MS„ and in some in·-
stances referring to more recent events, correcting the
lang-uage throughout, and curtailing or omitting matters
of English and European history foreign to the imme-
diate concems of the monastery.

I had to determine the question, which of the two
MSS. would be preferable for the text of the proposed
edition, and what use ought to be made of the second
copy. As both manuscripts were the author's autographs,
it seemed to me that the peculiarities of each ought to
be exactly represented3 and, as the Egerton MS. gave
the work in a revised form, it seemed advisable to make
that the foundation of the printed text, and to preserve
the various readings and additions of the Phillipps MS.
in scot-notes.

But this plan could only be followed in respect to
those portions of the chronicle which referred 1ο 1116
