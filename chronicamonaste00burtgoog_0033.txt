the convent was obliged to disperse. Abbot Adam,
humiliated by 1116 result of his own confidence, and
feeling himself under reproach for having surrendered
the charters to archbishop Roger, pretended an intention
of going to Rome, and declared his purpose to resign.
He retired to Wattom to live as an anchoret at the
newly founded priory there. He had remained there
seven years, when the church under which it is said he
passed his days was burnt to the ground, and he re·

lower for a dormitm-y.

resignation, we ought probably to understand that this
was a partial measure. We are told tha-t abbot Philip
found the monastery in a condition of extreme poverty,
but that by his activity he succeeded in re-establishing
it in prosperity and discipline.
