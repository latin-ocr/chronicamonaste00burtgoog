miles in circumference‚ containing arable land, with
meadow and pastura, and graced with an overhanging
wood. In this wood I presume the monastery was
erected, as we are told it was on the higher ground.
The whole estate was under cultivation, for it had been
the place of residence of Sir John Meaux', and his manor
house stood on the site of a Subsequent conventual
farm-building called the North Grange.

Whatever were the immediate attractione of the lo-
cality in the eyes of the monk Adam, it is certain that
nothing could have been more cheerless than the aspect
of the general neighbourhood. The 'whole country, to
the estuary of the Humber southwardS, and to the sea
coast eastward‚ was then as now an extensive, low and
fenny flat,--more forlorn then than now, because un-

the country appear to have been mainly the work of the
monks of Meaux. In this quality of utter dreariness of
situation, therefore, the first condition required by the
constitution of the Cistercian order was amply sulfilled.
The population‚ whatever it amounted tc, was hardly
within reach of any influence of civilization. There was
no town of note in the whole district east of the river
Hull; the port of Hedon‚ about seven miles south of
Meaux‚ being the nearest place of any importance. Of
religious houses there was only the college of Beverlcy in
the neighbourhood, and that difficult of access by the
intervention of the river Han, until the foundations of
the Cistercian nunnery of Swine, about four miles to the
south, aud the Gilbertine priory of Watton, about eight
miles to the north, both nearly contemporaneous with
the abbey of Meaux.

Here then, in the severity of mid-winter, the ardent
band of missionaries were left to their own resourceS. They
had to work hard with their own hands to render their
settlement habitabie, and to procuro their daily suste·
nance—not without difficulty at that period of the year.
The rude country people of Holderness flocked about
