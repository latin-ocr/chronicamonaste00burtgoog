my reasons for believing to exhibit the author’s revision
of his work, and to be written by his own hand. It is
frequently referred to by later writers, and is usually

It consiste at present of 214 leaves. On examination, it
appears that two leaves have been cut out at an early time,
previous to the pagination by Sir William Alford, and two
other leaves, numbered 168 and 169, subsequently to the
pagination, so that the original number of leaves was 218.
A note by Mr. John Nichols, written on a paper ily-leaf
