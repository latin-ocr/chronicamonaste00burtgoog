We may conclude, therefore, from his appetu-ing in this
list of the date of 1394 as twenty-second in seniority
out of a total number of only twenty-eight, of which the
convent was composed, that Burton must have been a.
monk of not many years’ standing, and probably under
thirty years of age.

The position and duties of bui-sar would be of advan-
tage in preparing him for the work of compiling the
history of the house. He would have acc-ess to the
records‚ and would be led to make himself sully ac-
quainted with the actual condition of the affairs of the
ι monastery, and probably to investigate the titles to
its several properties. · 1 think it likely that he com-
menced the composition of his chronicle whilst holding
the office. What was the exact nature of his duties as
servitor to the abbot I am not aware3 but it would
probably obtain from him the confidence of the ruler of
the house, and give him a. knowledge of the most impor-
tant business of the convent. I have met with nothing
to indicate the cause of his loss of office at Martinmas in
the year 1394 ; unless it might be connected with oer-
