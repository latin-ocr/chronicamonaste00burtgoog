In these earlier sections of English history our chro-
nicler has little to add to the events recorded in authors
now extant. In the later portionS, in which he ap-
proaches more nearly his own period, his narrative
shows many variatione from received authorities, and
these will be examined at a future opportunity.

With respect to the works referred to in the mar-gina
I may shortly state that those of Ailred of Rivauh,

Ralph de Dicet0‚ John of Brompton‚ and Thomas stubbs,
are quoted from the ‘⁸ Scriptores X.’' of Roger Twysden,

folio, 16523 as is also the Polychronicon of Ralph ’

Higden, the seventh book of which is incorporated in the
Chronicle of Henry Knighton‚ in the same collection.
Henry of Huntingdon and Roger Hoveden are cited
from the “ Scriptores post Bedam '' of Sir Hem-y Savile,
folio, 1601 ; Benedict of Peterborough‚ as edited by
Hearne3 and William of Malmesbury, Nicholas Trivet,
Walter of Hemingsord, and william of Newbury, in the
editions of the English Historical Society of London.

I cannot dismiss these remarks without again express-
ing my obligations to Sir Thomas Phillipps for his
kindness in allowing me access to his valuable copy of
the chronicles‚ and in favouring me with facilities for
transcribing and collating it, in repeated visits to his
library at Cheltenham.
