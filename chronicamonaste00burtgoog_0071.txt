tain dissensione in the convent, which Burton speaks
of, under William, the eighteenth abbot, on occasion of a
claim to the office of perpetual claustra] prior by a monk
who had successfully prosecuted a suit in the court of
Rome.1

F or the events relating to Burton’s election as abbot,
and to his administration of the office, we have the
authority of the continuator of his chronicle. It appears
that, after the resignation of william, of Scarborough, the

“eighteenth abbot‚ in the year 139 6, the convent was divided

in the choice of a successor 3 some of the body giving their
votes for william wendover, at that time prior, others for
Thomas Burton, “ a man both religious and well lettered.’'
But Wendover, “ conscious of being more experienced in
“ claustral matters than worldly affairs, and preferring
“ to be subject to control rather than to bear rule‚'’
pressed the preference of Burton3 whose election was
accordingly ratified by the father abbot of FountainS,
assisted by the abbot of Kirkstead. Subsequently, the
whole convent being assembled in the chief chamber of
the guest house, the election was again declared by their
public notary‚ Master Henry Burton of York‚ no one
making objection, and a public instrument was drawn up
in evidence and duly signed.

The first step of the newly elected abbot was to present
himself before Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Gloucester‚
wh0, being then lord of HoldcrneSS, stood in the relation
of founder to the monastery, and to offer homage. The
duke, however, flatly refused to recognize the election
until he had been assured of it by letters under the
common seal of the monastery. Having furnished him— ,
self, therefore, with this requisito certificate, Burton
again visited the duke, did due homage, and explained
to him the circumstances of the volunt-ary resignation
of William of Scarborough‚ his predecessor, and so
returned to the monastery a fully installcd abbot.
