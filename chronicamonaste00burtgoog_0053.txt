of about the end of the fourteenth century. It was pur-
chased out of a small annual fund bequeathed by Charles
Long‚ Lord Farnborough‚ to be laid out in additions to
the Egerton collection, founded by Francis Egerton, duke
of Bridgewater3 and the volume became N o. 1461 of the
Egerton manuscripts. The chronicle extends from the
foundation of the abbey, in the year 1150, to the resig-
nation of the eighteenth abbot, william of Scarborough,
in the year 1396, occupying 131 leaves, including indexes
and a table of the abbots placed at the beginning of the
volume. It is followed by a feodary, a rental, and
other pieces relating to the monastery, in the same hand.

An examination of the chronicle, as contained in this
MS„ enables us to conclude that the period of its com-
position, or recension, extended stom about the year 1394

, to as late as or later than 1400 ; and that it is the work

of a member of the convent, written throughout by the
author's own hand. ι

It is an indication of the date of the composition that
the table of the abbots at the beginning of the volume,
as first written, closed originally with the imperfect
entry‚ “ Willelmus abbas decimus octavus rexit monas-
“ terium,” while the same hand subsequently added the
words “ xxiiij. annis,'’ and at the same time wrote the

name “ Thomas,’' as the beginning of an intended entry
of the succession of Thomas de Burton, the nineteenth
abbot 3 showing that, when the table of abbots was first
compiled, abbot william, whose period was from ΑΒ.
1372 to 1396, was still governing the monastery, and
that the chronicle had not been brought to the end of
his abbacy. The· history itseli', however, terminates
with William's resignation, and adds that he survived
this event four γεω-ε, namely, to September 1400. It
was therefore in progress between the years 1372 and
1400, or later. Other evidences are collected from the
text of the chronicle. In the notice of the successive
holders of the honour of Holderness‚ at page 92, the death
of Ann, wife of king Richard ΙΙ., in the year 1394, is
