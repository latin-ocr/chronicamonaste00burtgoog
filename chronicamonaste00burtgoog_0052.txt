pannon xliii

In recounting the papal privileges obtained by the
monastery at this period, the chronicle makes a state-
ment directly bearing on the all-important question of
the degree of fidelity observed to the constitutions of
the order, regulating the austerities the monks were to
underg0, and which, indeed, they engaged themselves, by
their oath of profession, to submit to. Pope Honorius ΙΙΙ.
had granted to Meaux abbey the special privilege of ex-
emption from the payment of pecuniary procuratione
to the legate of the apostolic see 3 adding, that when
legates came to their house they were to content them-
selves with the regular food, without use of meat. The
chronicler observes upon this, that the privilege came to
nothing, for they were obliged to pay seven shillin gs
yearly, like the other monasteries of the order, to the
nuncio of the pope's chamber, besides contributing to
the expenses of cardinals and other legates who came
to England. And the privilege of denying provision of
meat for the legate could not be enforced, for this reason,
that in the abbey itself the monks had long been in the
habit of indulging in the use of meat, like mere laymen—

on the days, that is, when eating meat was not universally
prohibited.

add some observatione on the materials it furnishes for
illustrating monastic life, and subjects of local and anti-
quarian interest. I turn now to a notice of the manu-
scripts of the chronicle upon which the text has been
formed, and of the authorship of the work.
