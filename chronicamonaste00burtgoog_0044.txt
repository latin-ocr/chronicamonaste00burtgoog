PREFAOE. XXXV

Abbot Alexander was a leader 10 this opposition to the Hiq reaig-
king’s demands ς but he shortly found himself standing ”⁸⁰⁰2 ι
alone in the contest. In vain the other abbots and
prelates pressed him to yield to a power too strong for
him—to follow their example and hasten to court to sue
for the king’s peace. Appearing to relent, he took his
way in the direction they desired, but meeting in his
journey the abbot of Fountains‚ he offered him his resig-
nation, protesting, do what others would, that he would
never consent to the illegal exaction. The father abbot
persuaded him to retain his office from regard to the
advantage of the monastery, but failed 10 induce him to
submit to king J ohn. Yet he consented to write letters
to the 00110101· of the house, directing him to go 10 court
and try what arrangement he could effect, seeing that
Meaux stood alone in its resistanoe. Alexander him-
self kept away from the monastery, hoping to hear the
affair was settled. Meanwhile the abbey’s. property was
seized by 1110 king' s officers', from whom 1110 monks and
conver-ts, disper-sed in twos and threes through the dif-
ferent estates of the house, were obliged 10 purchase their
food. At the gates two king’s officers were placed,
without whose consent nothing could be taken out of
or brought 11110 1110 convent. All the monks were even-
1110] ly forced 10 leave the monastery, and were hospitably
received by Baldwin, earl of Albemarle, in his house at

Burstwick.
Seeing 111101 (1030101100 110 11οᾶ brought on the con-

vent, abbot Alexander finally resigned his office, sending
his seal to the monastery from Ford abbey, whither he had
retii-ed, 10 be delivered to the father abbot of Fountains.
The father abbot accepted the resignation, and requested
the abbot of Ford to proclaim Alexander's demission in
his chapter house, according 10 1110 custom of the order.
Meanwhile the cellarer had come to an agreement with
the king, by submitting to a fine of 000 thousand marks,
-an excessivo imposition, but which, not without un-

speakable injury, the monastery succeeded in paying.
