historical portions of the chronicle, I have followed the
division of chapters which I found in it3 and this in
some instances occasions a want of continuity in the
order, but which is always explained in the foot-notae.

In printing the tables of chapters at the beginning of
the volume from both manuscripta I hope to have ren-
dered the differences in these divisions more conspicuous,
and to have made reference to the two volumes more

The various readings in the {bot-notes represent a
minute collation of the texts3 but insignificant variations
will be disregarded in the latter part of the work.

the history of the abbacy of Thomas de Burton, nineteenth
abbot, and of a portion of that of his successor, william
of wendover, was headed by a prologue, in which the
author-imitating‚ by the way, rather closely the preface
to the first author's revised work—sets forth his object
‘of preserving the memory of the acts of the illustrious
abbots of the house, regretting that this had been neg-
lected, and ends with a distinct reference to the first
chronicle. And it is evident that he had in his mind
the earlier form of it, extant in the Phillipps MS„ for he
apologizes for not including, as that does, a narrative of
public events, stating that he has no copy of any history
of affairs for the period he treats of. I draw attention
to this because, although the. two works are in the same
volume, they are written on paper of different textures,
and may originally have been distinct manuscripta
