plough land, with pasture ‘for as many cow3, in Hoton
in Whitbystrand‚ with St. Leonard's hermitage there3
also a stretch of pasture on the Humber, known by the
names of Saltagh and N ewland‚ with a carucata ¹ of
land close by in Kayingham, about ten miles away
southward from the monastery. The convent, how-
ever, was tricked into giving as much as sixty marks—-
some 600l.‚ estimated in modern coin and value—to buy
off all claime on the property. With a view to the
convenience of the monks in aocess to the country south
of the Humber, the earl conferred on them the impor-
tant right of free passage at a place called at that time
Pagula, now Paul, and also a house at Eetion, where they
might find harbourage in going to and returning from
Saltagh and the serry at Paul.

The chronicle does honour to the founder of the
monastery by reeording the genealogy of his family, adding
that he survived the foundation twenty-nine yearS, and
was buried at Thornton abbey, a house of his own crea·
tion. It is gratifying to find that in his lifetime he
was not without some solaoe from his generosity to the
four abbeys he had original-ed and endowed. We are
assured that, in his frequent passages of the sea on mili-
tary expeditions, when the storm raged he would lie
restless and in conceivable discomfort‚ until midnight, at
which hour his Cluniae and Augustinian monks of Aumale
and Thornton were rising to their nocturne, when, con-
fiding in their prayerS, he would quietly fall asleep ; and
at cock-crow, if he woke again, he was once more lulled
·to slumber by remembering that the Cistercian brethren
of Vaudey and Meaux were hastening to chant their
vigile.
