contest and resigned his office of abbot. The continuator

He yielded up his office personally in the chapter
house of Fountains abbey on the eve of the Assumption

having governed the monastery three years and five

the chief of his benefits to the monastery was 1113 resig-
nation of his authority. Posterity will aa heartily ap-
plaud the generous resolution, for it owes to it the ·
preservation of the history of the house in the chronicle
now published. , He concludes his notice of Burton's
abbacy by stating, that after 1113 retirement he compiled
the first book of chronicles of the monastery, and brought
together the feodaries, rentals, and other evidences of
the monastery,—very often, he adds, of the greatest use to
his successore ;1 but that afterwardS‚ some eight years or
more before his death, he became blind, and thus ended

tells us also that he was buried before the altar of Saint
Stephen in the conventual church. He intended to
have added how long he survived his resignation,
but left the sentence incomplete by omission of the
number of the yearS. A happy chance enables us to
supply the void. The monumental effigy of Thomas
Burton is extant on a stone slab preserved in the garden
of a house on the site of the abbey. The inscription,
