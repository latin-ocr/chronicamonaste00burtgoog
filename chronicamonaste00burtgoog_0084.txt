adopted in the present series of publicatione, of marking
by smaller type passages clearly traceable to earlier
authors, and which I have endeavoured to apply in the
present work, enables me to dispense with more than
a general notice of the authorities upon which our
chronicler bas based these portione of his history. And
Ι prefer to confine my remarks at present to so much of
these historical chapters of the chronicle as is contained
in the present volume.

In respect then to the papa] and foreign history gene-
rally, the authority most directly quoted from I find to be
the Polychronicon of Ralph Higden. But frequently, in
substance and sometimes in expressions,.1 trace passages
of the “ Cronica Summorum Pontificum et Imperatorum‚''
of Martinus Polonus, a history very popular in the
fourteenth century. And, although events are introduced
into the narrative which are not met with in the origi-
nal work of Martinus, I think it probable that Burton
made his extracta from one of those enlarged copies, of
which many are extant at the present day, not entirely
agreeing with each other in the additions to the ‚first
author, but ext-ended by supplementary matter intro-
duced according to the selection of the scribe or compilor.

he may have used additional authorities. Under the
second abbot Alexander, from 1159 to 1185, the notice
of events connected with the pope and the emperor
Frederic is fuller than it could have been made from
Martinus Polo-nm, and I have' referred in the margin
to apparently a more direct source, in the “ Flores
“ Chronicorum '² of Bernardus Gnidonis, printed in
Muratori’s “ Rerum Italicarum Scriptores.”

For the history of the succession to the see of York
our author copies verbatim from the “ Chronicon Ponti-
“ ficum ecclesiae Eboraci,'' of Thomas stubbs, printed in
Twysden's collection. But even in these extracts he
sometimes interpolates circumstances not recorded by his
