wanted the money for a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. His
father, Robert, who had held the important office of
sheriff of Yorkshire‚ afterwards became a monk in the
monastery.

William Fossard‚ the head of a distinguished Yorkshire
family, gave to the monastery two carucatas of land in
Wharrom,—as far as five and twenty miles from the mo-

was given to the monastery by Robert of Stuteville, lord of
Cottingham. The career of William Fossard the younger
was wrecked by this early foll y. He was afterwards driven
